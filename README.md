PK: a Scalable Algorithm to Compute Kernel-Stable Payments for Social Ridesharing
===================
PK is an algorithm to compute [Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory#The_kernel)-stable payments for [Social Ridesharing](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/download/9622/9303). PK has been presented by Filippo Bistaffa, Georgios Chalkiadakis, Alessandro Farinelli, and Sarvapali D. Ramchurn in “[Recommending Fair Payments for Large-Scale Social Ridesharing](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2792838.2800177)”, Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), pages 139–146, 2015, ACM.
