PK: a Scalable Algorithm to Compute Kernel-Stable Payments for Social Ridesharing
===================
PK is an algorithm to compute [Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory#The_kernel)-stable payments for [Social Ridesharing](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/download/9622/9303). PK has been presented by Filippo Bistaffa, Georgios Chalkiadakis, Alessandro Farinelli, and Sarvapali D. Ramchurn in “[Recommending Fair Payments for Large-Scale Social Ridesharing](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2792838.2800177)”, Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), pages 139–146, 2015, ACM.

Requirements
----------
PK requires `g++` to compile, and does not require any external library to execute.

Execution
----------
PK must be executed by means of the [`pk.sh`](pk.sh) script, i.e.,
```
Usage: ./pk.sh -i <filename> [-e <epsilon>] [-c]

-i	Input filename
-e	Epsilon
-c	Enable CSV output
```
where `filename` is the solution file generated by [SR-CFSS](https://github.com/filippobistaffa/SR-CFSS) using the `-p` command-line option.

Input File Format
----------
`INPUTFILE` is the path of the input file, which must be structured according to the following format.

  * `N` (i.e., the number of agents) in the first line.
  * `K` (i.e., the maximum coalition cardinality) in the second line.
  * `SEED` (i.e., the seed used to generate the pseudo-random SR instance) in the third line.
  * `N` lines, each containing the list of the neighbours of the i<sup>th</sup> agent in the graph. Specifically, each line must be formatted in the following way.
	  * First number is the agent's degree *d* in the graph
	  * The following *d* numbers are the indices of the agent's neighbours in the graph
  * `M` lines representing the `M` coalitions in the solution coalition structure. Each line must contain the coalition's members. Drivers must be marked by preceding their indices with `*` (e.g., `*0` means that `0` is a driver).

The following example file represents a solution of the instance with `SEED` = 47, `K` = 5, and with the following graph.
<p align="center"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cFGCpbz.png" width="500" /></p>
The solution coalition structure is `{{9},{6},{2},{7,0,1,3,8},{4},{5}}`, where `7` is a driver.
